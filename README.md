Project Overview
This app is a Vue quiz application designed to provide users with a series of questions in a specific category. The application is built using modern front-end technologies, including Vue 3, TypeScript, Pinia for state management, and Vue Router for navigation. Users can navigate through questions, view their progress, and see a summary of their results at the end of the quiz. The app is also equipped with unit tests using Vitest to ensure code quality and reliability.
